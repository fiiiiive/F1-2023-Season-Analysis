# Jeddah Analysis 2023
What a crazy race! From midfield battles, to RedBull drama, it wasn't the most exciting race, but it stayed exciting all the way around.
# Qualifying
This qualifying was incredibly interesting. After the race in Bahrain, I wanted to see how many 
of the teams settled into their 2023 form. For me I chose Ferrari and RedBull to take a look at
especially, because where RedBull seems to have gotten better, the Ferrari seems to have made 
little to no progress at all in catching them.

Before we analyze these graphs it is important to note that there were track changes, with one of them being incredibly important to this analysis. Around T22 to T23,
the S shape was squeezed to slow down drivers more to improve safety. According to Formula 1 this would slow down the drivers upwards of 50 kph. Firstly looking at the
speed graphs for each team we can see this drastic drop in the 2023 plot, and the difference is approximately 50 kph. 
So I would say that the change worked as intended. However it somewhat skews the laptimes. These cars are faster, yet this section slows down the cars so much it means 
that the 2022 laptimes look faster than the 2023 ones. Just something of note before we go into the graphs.

The first thing I notice here in these 2023 cars is the noticable top speed advantage these 2023 cars have. In Ferrari it is a lot more noticable but even RedBull made 
some gains in the top speed department. Another thing I see is there seems to be a slight cornering advantage in the medium to high speed corners as well. In the RedBull throttle graph, 
Perez is able to get off the throttle slightly later, and get back on the power earlier, and in the delta graph we can see it slowly rising as he goes through the medium/high 
speed corners of Section 1 and 2. These cars seem to like these corners a lot more and more as the teams continue developing within these aerodynamic regulations. 
Regardless, I believe both teams made steps in the right direction, yet Ferrari's race pace will continue to hurt them as it did last year.

One team that definitely did not take steps in the right direction were McLaren. Despite all of that, Oscar Piastri, the rookie to the team, managed to slot his car
not just into Q3, but also in 9th ahead of the Alpine of Pierre Gasly. After the disaster of a qualifying and race that was Bahrain, it was nice to see that the McLaren 
has the potential to compete in the right conditions. Below is the qualifying graph.
